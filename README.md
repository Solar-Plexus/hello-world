# hello-world
Hello, Hackathon guys! This is my first repository! :D

10-29-15 4:31 PDT: This repository and readme is created for the sole purpose of practice and getting my feet wet. If you'd like to do so as well, join me and follow the instructions on https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

10-29-15 4:35 PDT: This is a new branch for practice to see how one might look like. This edit serves as a difference to the master branch.
